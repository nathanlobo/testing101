# 🏎️ McLaren CreditMemo Agent v1.0

**AI-Powered Credit Memo Generation for Financial Due Diligence**

Built for the **Orix McLaren Hackathon 2026**

---

## 🎯 Overview

McLaren CreditMemo Agent transforms dense financial PDFs (Balance Sheets, 10-Ks, Annual Reports) into structured, audit-ready Credit Memos in **under 5 seconds**. Every claim is backed by source citations for full traceability.

### The Problem
Manual credit memo creation takes hours. Analysts manually extract metrics, cross-reference pages, and format reports. Error-prone. Slow. Painful.

### The Solution
Upload PDF → Get structured memo with:
- ✅ Executive Summary (5 key bullets)
- ✅ Key Metrics Table (Revenue, EBITDA, Debt Ratio with YoY comparison)
- ✅ Risk Analysis (Top 3 risks + mitigation strategies)
- ✅ Source Citations (Every fact links to [Page X])
- ✅ Interactive Refinement (Chat to adjust tone/detail)
- ✅ Export Ready (.md and .docx formats)

---

## 🚀 Features

### AI-Powered Analysis
